# How to use
1. Make sure your environment is set up correctly to build rust projects (you must have rust/cargo installed properly)
2. Clone repository with `git clone https://github.com/hhhzzzsss/rust-raytracer` on the command line
3. Enter the directory (`cd rust-raytracer`)
4. `cargo run`
5. Wait for the project to run (it may take a while), and it should generate render.png, which is the image output
